/**
 * An AST-like structure which represents a SQL "expression".
 *
 * Note (Terminology):
 *    "Expression" is in quotes above because it differs from the definition of
 *    a SQL expression. In SQL, an expression is basically anything that can be
 *    put inside a SELECT statement, whereas here, it may basically be any
 *    "piece" of the SQL AST. For example, "WHERE foo = 'bar'" is not a SQL
 *    expression (the query `SELECT WHERE foo='bar'` is not valid) but is
 *    considered a valid Expr.
 *
 *    tl;dr: Expr's are building blocks of queries and nothing more.
 *
 * Note (Inspiration):
 *    This system draws from my experience with Julia (which I believe in turn
 *    draws from Lisp). Definitely check it out!
